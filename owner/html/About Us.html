    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We are on a mission to reduce food waste and fight hunger by connecting restaurants with NGOs and local communities in need. Our platform makes it easy for donors to share leftover food, and for NGOs to collect and distribute it efficiently.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <p>At the heart of our platform is a simple idea: no food should go to waste while people are still hungry. We are committed to providing a solution that helps reduce food waste, alleviate hunger, and build stronger communities. By connecting donors and NGOs in real-time, we aim to make a tangible difference in the fight against hunger.</p>
      
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Our platform allows restaurants to post available food donations, which are then matched with nearby NGOs for quick pickup. NGOs can reserve donations through the platform, ensuring they receive what they need without any delay. Through our real-time alerts and user-friendly interface, we aim to make the food donation process as simple and efficient as possible.</p>
